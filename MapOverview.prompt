I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository.
