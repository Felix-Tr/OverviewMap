**task_prompt**: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields.

The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository.".

Modality: "web component".

Programming Language: " JavaScript"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via  JavaScript. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To fulfill the customer's requirements, we will create the following files:

1. index.html: This file will serve as the entry point for the web component. It will include the necessary HTML structure and import the JavaScript files.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Interactive Map of Germany</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <div id="map"></div>
  <script src="main.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

2. styles.css: This file will contain the CSS styles for the web component.

```css
#map {
  height: 400px;
  width: 100%;

    });
  }

  render() {
    return <div id="map"></div>;
  }
}

// Fetch project data from JSON file
fetch('projects.json')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    ReactDOM.render(<InteractiveMap projects={data} />, document.getElementById('map'));
  });
```

4. projects.json: This file will contain the project data in JSON format.

```json

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the necessary imports for the React, ReactDOM, and Leaflet libraries. These imports are required for the code to work properly.

<SUGGESTION>
In the react.js file, add the following import statements at the top of the file:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import L from 'leaflet';
```

This will ensure that the required libraries are imported and available for use in the code.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is missing the necessary imports for the React, ReactDOM, and Leaflet libraries. These imports are required for the code to work properly.

<SUGGESTION>
In the react.js file, add the following import statements at the top of the file:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import L from 'leaflet';
```

This will ensure that the required libraries are imported and available for use in the code."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

<COMMENT>
The code provided is almost complete and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

1. In the React component `InteractiveMap`, the `render` method is returning a `<div>` element with the id "map". However, this id is already used by the `<div>` element in the HTML file. This can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, you can update the id of the `<div>` element in the `render` method to a unique id, such as "interactive-map". Here's the updated code:

```js
render() {
  return <div id="interactive-map"></div>;
}
```

With this change, the React component will render the map into the correct `<div>` element without conflicts.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready for use.

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is almost complete and follows the requirements specified by the user. However, there is one issue that needs to be addressed:

1. In the React component `InteractiveMap`, the `render` method is returning a `<div>` element with the id "map". However, this id is already used by the `<div>` element in the HTML file. This can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.

To fix this issue, you can update the id of the `<div>` element in the `render` method to a unique id, such as "interactive-map". Here's the updated code:

```js
render() {
  return <div id="interactive-map"></div>;
}
```

With this change, the React component will render the map into the correct `<div>` element without conflicts.

Once you make this change, the code should be ready for use."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Code Reviewer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can help programmers to assess source codes for software troubleshooting, fix bugs to increase code quality and robustness, and offer proposals to improve the source codes.
Here is a new customer's task: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

Programming Language: "{language}" Ideas: "{ideas}" Codes: "{codes}" As the {assistant_role}, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations: 1) all referenced classes should be imported; 2) all methods should be implemented; 3) all methods need to have the necessary comments; 4) no potential bugs; 5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user; 6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement; Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like " Finished". |

However, this id is already used by the &lt;div&gt; element in the HTML file. This can cause conflicts and unexpected behavior.\n\nTo fix this issue, you can update the id of the &lt;div&gt; element in the render method to a unique id, such as "interactive-map". Here\'s the updated code:\n\njs\nrender() {\n  return &lt;div id="interactive-map"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;;\n}\n\n\nWith this change, the React component will render the map into the correct &lt;div&gt; element without conflicts.\n\nOnce you make this change, the code should be ready for use.'} |

As the Code Reviewer, to make the software directly operable without further coding, ChatDev have formulated the following regulations:
1) all referenced classes should be imported;
2) all methods should be implemented;
3) all methods need to have the necessary comments;
4) no potential bugs;
5) The entire project conforms to the tasks proposed by the user;
6) most importantly, do not only check the errors in the code, but also the logic of code. Make sure that user can interact with generated software without losing any feature in the requirement;
Now, you should check the above regulations one by one and review the codes in detail, propose one comment with the highest priority about the codes, and give me instructions on how to fix. Tell me your comment with the highest priority and corresponding suggestions on revision. If the codes are perfect and you have no comment on them, return only one line like "<INFO> Finished".

[ChatDev is a software company powered by multiple intelligent agents, such as chief executive officer, chief human resources officer, chief product officer, chief technology officer, etc, with a multi-agent organizational structure and the mission of "changing the digital world through programming".
You are Programmer. we are both working at ChatDev. We share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
You can write/create computer software or applications by providing a specific programming language to the computer. You have extensive computing and coding experience in many varieties of programming languages and platforms, such as Python, Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, XML, SQL, PHP, etc,.
Here is a new customer's task: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository..
To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

<COMMENT>
The code provided is a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, which seems to be a mistake. The task specifically mentions that the component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Therefore, the Python code and the index.py file are not necessary and should be removed.

<SUGGESTION>
Remove the Python code and the index.py file from the project.

Task: "I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields. The component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Data for each project will be stored and managed in JSON format. The goal is to create a component that can function both as a standalone tool and be easily embedded into other websites. Additionally, the entire project will be hosted on GitHub, making it accessible for direct use and contributions from the GitHub repository.".

Comments on Codes:
"<COMMENT>
The code provided is a mix of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, which seems to be a mistake. The task specifically mentions that the component should be designed using React.js, with Leaflet for map functionality. Therefore, the Python code and the index.py file are not necessary and should be removed.

<SUGGESTION>
Remove the Python code and the index.py file from the project."
In the software, each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code. Format:
FILENAME
```LANGUAGE
'''
DOCSTRING
'''
CODE
```
As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demand and make the software creative, executive and robust, you should modify corresponding codes according to the comments. Then, output the full and complete codes with all bugs fixed based on the comments. Return all codes strictly following the required format.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:

requirements.txt

```

numpy==1.19.2

pandas>=1.1.4

```

According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Based on the provided codes and file format, the requirements.txt file should specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. In this case, the project is developed using JavaScript and React.js, so there is no need for a requirements.txt file.

The dependencies for the JavaScript and React.js project are typically managed using a package.json file. The package.json file lists the required packages and their versions. In this case, the required packages are already included in the provided code snippets, such as React, ReactDOM, and Leaflet.

To manage the dependencies for the JavaScript and React.js project, you can use the following command to initialize a new package.json file:

```
npm init
```

This command will guide you through the process of creating a package.json file and specifying the required packages. You can follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.

Once the package.json file is created, you can install the required packages using the following command:

```
npm install
```

This command will read the dependencies specified in the package.json file and install them in the project.

Therefore, there is no need for a requirements.txt file in this case. The dependencies for the JavaScript and React.js project should be managed using the package.json file and the npm package manager.

As the Programmer, you should write a requirements.txt file, which is commonly used in Python projects to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. It serves as a way to document and manage the project's dependencies in a standardized format. For example:
requirements.txt
```
numpy==1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.4
```
According to the codes and file format listed above, write a requirements.txt file to specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly.

Programmer: Based on the provided codes and file format, the requirements.txt file should specify the dependencies or packages required for the project to run properly. In this case, the project is developed using JavaScript and React.js, so there is no need for a requirements.txt file.

You are Counselor. Now, we share a common interest in collaborating to successfully complete a task assigned by a new customer.
Your main responsibilities include asking what user and customer think and provide your valuable suggestions. 
Here is a new customer's task: I'm planning to develop a reusable, embeddable web component that displays an interactive map of Germany. This map will highlight various locations, each representing a different project. For each project location, the map will show metadata including the project name, technology stack used, project duration (e.g., 2021-2023), and other extendable fields.

To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

As the task involves developing a web component using React.js and JavaScript, there is no need for a requirements.txt file. Instead, the dependencies for the project should be managed using a package.json file and the npm package manager.

To specify the dependencies for the project, you can create a package.json file by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm init
```

This command will guide you through the process of creating a package.json file and specifying the required packages. You will be prompted to provide information such as the package name, version, description, entry point, and more. You can press enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

Once the package.json file is created, you can add the required packages as dependencies. In this case, the required packages are React, ReactDOM, and Leaflet. You can install these packages and add them as dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install react react-dom leaflet --save
```

This command will install the specified packages and add them to the dependencies section of the package.json file.

After installing the dependencies, you can use them in your project by importing them in your JavaScript files. For example, you can import React and ReactDOM in your main.js file like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

Similarly, you can import Leaflet in your main.js file like this:

```js
import L from 'leaflet';
```

By managing the dependencies using the package.json file and the npm package manager, you can easily install, update, and manage the required packages for your project.

To specify the dependencies for the project, you can create a package.json file by running the following command in the project directory:

```
npm init
```

This command will guide you through the process of creating a package.json file and specifying the required packages. You will be prompted to provide information such as the package name, version, description, entry point, and more. You can press enter to accept the default values or provide your own.

Once the package.json file is created, you can add the required packages as dependencies. In this case, the required packages are React, ReactDOM, and Leaflet. You can install these packages and add them as dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install react react-dom leaflet --save
```

This command will install the specified packages and add them to the dependencies section of the package.json file.

After installing the dependencies, you can use them in your project by importing them in your JavaScript files. For example, you can import React and ReactDOM in your main.js file like this:

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
```

Similarly, you can import Leaflet in your main.js file like this:

```js
import L from 'leaflet';
```

By managing the dependencies using the package.json file and the npm package manager, you can easily install, update, and manage the required packages for your project.

# LangChain

Building applications with LLMs through composability

Looking for the JS/TS version? Check out LangChain.js.

**Production Support:** As you move your LangChains into production, we'd love to offer more comprehensive support.

Please fill out this form and we'll set up a dedicated support Slack channel.

## Quick Install

`pip install langchain`

or

`conda install langchain -c conda-forge`

## 🤔 What is this?

Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. However, using these LLMs in isolation is often insufficient for creating a truly powerful app - the real power comes when you can combine them with other sources of computation or knowledge.

This library aims to assist in the development of those types of applications. Common examples of these applications include:

**❓ Question Answering over specific documents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: Question Answering over Notion Database

**🤖 Agents**

- Documentation

- End-to-end Example: GPT+WolframAlpha

## 📖 Documentation

Please see [here](https://python.langchain.com) for full documentation on:

- Getting started (installation, setting up the environment, simple examples)

- How-To examples (demos, integrations, helper functions)

- Reference (full API docs)
